### Java-Microservice-Backend-Project 
This project demonstrates the advantages of microservices architecture by creating a system with independent yet interconnected services (Memes, Users, and Meme Categories). Using Spring Cloud ZooKeeper for dynamic service discovery and OpenZipkin for tracing, the project highlights how this approach enhances scalability, flexibility, and monitoring in distributed systems.

### Arduino projects
In my Arduino projects, I applied my electrical engineering skills to design and build functional prototypes that integrate hardware and software. These projects demonstrate my ability to create and implement circuits, manage data flow, and develop interactive systems, showcasing my expertise in both electronics and programming.
